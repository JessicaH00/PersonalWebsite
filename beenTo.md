#### February 28, 2014 -- Departure

In the morning, my mom and I left for the Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport(YUL) of Montreal. Two hours after, we got on the plane and left for our one week trip to Vancouver and Yellowknife.

After six hours on the plane, we finally got off at the Vancouver International Airport(YVR) of Vancouver. This place is a lot warmer than Montreal.

After putting down our luggages at the hotel, we had dinner with mom’s friends from high school. They gave us some suggestions on what to do for the next two days, before we leave for Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, on March 3rd.


#### March 1, 2014 -- Bike around The Stanley Park

The weather that day was very nice. Sunny, a few clouds, warm(around 5&deg;C to 10&deg;C).
In the morning, we walked around the city and saw Vancouver's oldest church and the Vancouver Art Gallary.

At noon, we had brunch and at around 2:30pm, we rented a tandem bicycle and rode around the Stanley Park.
